- video at https://youtu.be/CGRSjjxyz-k
### Information
The European Green Deal aims to transform the European Union’s economy, environment, and energy system, while improving prosperity and people’s well-being, through cleaner air and water, better health, and a thriving natural world. The European Green Deal represents a global first as a regional framework of regulation and legislation to fight the climate crisis and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, particularly with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and a 50-55% reduction in emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. It can therefore influence not only other national and regional targets and pathways, but also a possible Global Green Deal, setting the world on a climate-safe pathway towards carbon neutrality by 2050 aligned with the Paris Agreement. IRENA’s report, World Energy Transitions Outlook, provides a basis for this pathway in line with 1.5°C and net-zero CO2 emissions by midcentury, requiring urgent action on multiple fronts.

## Energy Community Engagement in Local Flexibility Markets
- video at https://youtu.be/947TZw052J8
### Information
In a regulatory context defined by decreasing direct support for renewable energy, energy communities increasingly focus on direct self-consumption of generated electricity. Whilst beyond the investment in clean energy generation technologies, this drives the uptake of storage and demand-side solutions, a too narrow focus on self-consumption risks leading to sub-optimal investments and a cost-ineffective energy transition. Hence, it is of importance to encourage energy communities to interact with the wider energy system by providing local flexibility services to the distribution system.
In this light, this session focusses on the challenges and opportunities of engaging energy communities in local flexibility markets and aims to identify key action drivers and regulatory solutions. The panel will consist of a regulator, a DSO association, a European business association, an energy community interest group, a university researcher and an energy consultancy firm. 

## Energy Efficiency First: From principle to reality
- video at https://youtu.be/bdAI4P4iGc4
### Information
The purpose of the session is to exchange good practices and experiences with the application of the EE1st principle in the context of the recently adopted recommendations and guidelines of the European Commission on the application of the principle. The session will also aim at discussing possible way forward in further promotion of the principle and ensuring its wide application. 

## Reinforcing sustainability of the offshore renewable energy sector
- video at https://youtu.be/D9T9sbOp_9E
### Information
Offshore renewable energy is a cornerstone of the EU's energy vision and its decarbonisation goals for 2030 and beyond. The Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy recognises this important contribution and proposes ways forward to support the long-term sustainable development of this sector. To achieve the ambition, there is further need for technological development, commercialisation and investment. At the same time, we must ensure a sustainable use of the oceans and address other challenges such as planning and consenting in the context of competition for sea space. This session will assess where we stand, one year on from the adoption of the Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy, and address key issues for its implementation as well as highlighting activities that can help to ensure 'green/blue' energy plays its part in a new European energy system. Speakers will bring perspectives from the levels of policy setting, sea basin planning and actual implementation in the water.

## The European Solar Initiative: 20 GW of European PV production by 2025
- video at https://youtu.be/dMJeiCkzHoU
### Information
Solar PV is the new oil of the energy system: it will be the first installed capacity in Europe by 2025 (IEA) and will generate at least 60% of our electricity by 2050. The Commission identified solar, with other renewable technologies, as part of the 14 key industrial ecosystems in the new Industrial Strategy and Recovery Package.
Redeveloping a solar PV manufacturing capacity is of strategic importance for Europe, taking the opportunity of the EU’s solid industrial ecosystem and reasserted technological leadership on the next generation of cells and modules. Industrial investments are already happening, with several GW-scale cells and modules manufacturing projects.
This session will discuss the regulatory and market drivers needed to unlock further investment in the solar PV value-chain in Europe. It will present the achievements of the European Solar Initiative, an industry-led initiative aiming at redeveloping 20-GW of solar PV manufacturing capacity by 2025. 

## Data centres: Can the cloud be climate neutral?
- video at https://youtu.be/iOF2kpHSSYU
### Information
How much energy does it take to stream an episode of Money Heist? Probably, more than you think. And Netflix is just one of the many data-intensive online services that we use every day. By 2030, data centres will represent 3.2% of the EU’s total electricity demand. Limiting the environmental impact of data centres will require ambitious action. It won’t be easy. Data centres are essential infrastructure, right at the intersection between two highly prioritised policy areas: the digital and the energy transition. The nature of the industry, with its range of business models and scales and the complexity of their operations, makes designing policy difficult. As a result, the industry is still largely self-regulated regarding energy efficiency. 

## Buildings at the heart of the EU’s new energy system
- video at https://youtu.be/bC5MsRPTCW4
### Information
This policy session will shed light on the potential that buildings offer for a successful transformation of the energy system by 2030 by empowering citizens at all levels and enabling the scale-up of holistic energy renovations. The speakers will present inspiring initiatives and best practices that are already in place at neighbourhood (Syn.ikia’s Sustainable Plus Energy Neighbourhoods), city (the MAtchUP project in València) and community level (REScoop’s citizen-led renovation). The presentations will highlight ways to empower residents to play a role in the energy transition while responding to their needs, especially lower-income households. These solutions place buildings in a broader and more interlinked context by reducing their energy use, acting as storage and ensuring a balanced grid, integrating renewables, using smart energy management systems as well as offering people a comfortable environment where to live. 

## Local authorities: How to get fit for the 55% target – Supporting Initiatives and best practice
- video at https://youtu.be/7q84BevIMg4
### Information
The EU Commission has announced in spring the updated emission reduction target of net 55% for 2030 compared to 1990. Local authorities – big cities, but also medium- and small-sized municipalities – now face the challenge of having to further speed-up their efforts in achieving this target also on their territories. Ambitious target setting is the first step for local authorities, defining the most cost efficient and the most effective actions and measures to really reach these targets and implementing them are the next steps which are probably even more demanding than the target setting. The session will focus on all these challenges for local authorities in order to support them with their tasks and share experiences from European Energy Award communities and from the H2020 projects CoME EASY, IMPLEMENT and EXCITE. The session may also bring insights to national and EU level representatives regarding the important contributions local authorities provide. 

## System efficiency: The enabler of a cost-effective decarbonisation
- video at https://youtu.be/ty_q_-FEVNM
### Information
System efficiency is critical to reach Europe’s climate neutrality objective in a cost-effective way. It means having an optimised and flexible energy system capable of supporting cost-effectively the increasing penetration of variable renewable electricity in all end-use sectors. This session is organised by smartEn – smart Energy Europe, together with T&D Europe – the association for Europe’s grid technology providers, the NGO RAP – The Regulatory Assistance Project, and the European association the Coalition for Energy Savings who will share, alongside institutional speakers, their perspective on how to achieve system efficiency and reap all the benefits of a flexible consumption both for the system and the end users, while supporting the decarbonisation of the EU economy. 

## Supporting the just energy transition: Opportunities for Africa and Asia

This session will discuss challenges and opportunities related to the increase of Electric Vehicles (EVs) that will occur over the next years. It will touch upon the issue of smart sector integration as a means to meet the EU Green Deal targets – with a focus on e-mobility. The research, industry, policy and customer perspectives on e-mobility will allow to have a 360-degree view of this new technology development and its impact for the whole European energy system by 2030 and beyond.

## Delivering on the Green Deal: How competitive and innovative is our clean energy sector? (Connect through WEBEX link in description)
- video at XXX
### Information
Connect to the session by clicking here  
According to the IEA, almost half of the emissions reductions needed by 2050 will come from technologies that are currently at demonstration or prototype phase. The innovation ecosystem has a crucial role to play to ensure that the innovative ideas of tomorrow are developed today. The 2nd competitiveness report shows that the EU does well when it comes to inventive capacity and start-ups, but trails other major economies in the ability to scale.
The green transition will require unprecedented investments in innovation and new technologies. Europe will need an estimated EUR 390 billion in additional investment per year over this decade to meet its 2030 emissions-reduction target. To get there, the alignment of all sources of finance is required.
The session will focus on the EU innovation ecosystem, the opportunities to exploit, the challenges to overcome to strengthen the link between innovation and deployment, and shorten the innovation cycle. 

## Fully exploiting the water-energy nexus: Measuring energy savings and CO2 emissions reduction
- video at https://youtu.be/NGbpbQHPVwY 
### Information
The session proposes a discussion on how to quantify energy savings and related emission reductions from smart water management and water efficiency measures. Water and energy are highly interdependent (‘water-energy nexus’): energy is needed to abstract, distribute, heat, cool, treat and desalinate water while water is also needed for energy production and cooling systems. In the EU, the water and wastewater sectors account for 3.5% of electricity consumption. At the level of municipalities this takes the largest share of the local budget, representing 30-40% of the total electricity bill. During the session, a high-level panel of speakers will discuss how to fully realize this energy saving potential in view of the recent and future policy and regulatory framework. 

## Research for policy: Energy efficiency and sustainable buildings
- video at https://youtu.be/D-pgHWXm4EM
### Information
The aim of the session is to bring together different perspectives on the contribution of research and innovation actions for effective making and implementation of EU policies, in the field of energy efficiency and sustainable buildings. The event will involve policy makers, representatives of the academic world, businesses and industries, to take stock on best practices (H2020) and discuss perspectives (Horizon Europe) on contribution of R&I to policy making and implementation, in the light of relevant EU priorities and objectives (2050 climate neutrality, energy transition and digitalisation, European Green Deal, Renovation Wave, New European Bauhaus).

## Is the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” fit for the Paris Agreement and SDGs?
- video at https://youtu.be/D0N4syJIIzU
### Information
In an effort to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the European Commission’s “Fit for 55 Package” aligns with the European Union’s updated target to reduce emissions of net 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, from the current 40% emissions reduction target. Delivering on the updated target with a coherent policy framework to support implementation across sectors would modernise the economy, delivering innovation and a competitive edge, while ensuring security and resilience of energy supply and health benefits. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook: 1.5°C Pathway outlines how the world can achieve the Paris Agreement goals and halt the pace of climate change by transforming the global energy landscape. The session will highlight how the European Union’s “Fit for 55 Package” can help achieve global goals of meeting the Paris Agreement and achieving Sustainable Development Goals, while ensuring a just, inclusive, and systemic transition depicted in IRENA’s Word Energy Transitions Outlook.

## How to achieve climate neutrality through grid enhancing technologies?
- video at https://youtu.be/zUQc3JUCbMo 
### Information
Innovation and a new system approach are the indispensable conditions to see networks enhance, not delay or even block, the unprecedented energy transition we are in. The Infrastructure Forum in 2019, the ENTSO-E Technopedia and the CETTIR report by the European Commission have flagged this.
What are the relevant regulatory pieces that could contribute to the uptake of grid enhancing technologies and thus the needed uptake of Renewables?
The TEN-E framework is a central one that shapes how networks will work in the future and what framework conditions are put on them. The TEN-E proposal is likely to be adopted after trilogues and discussion in Summer 2022. It is, therefore, a perfect time to discuss this from the technology angle in October 2021, when there is still room for improvement and how it is linked to other regulatory pieces like the EED or Smart Grid Indicator. 

## New European Bauhaus: Connecting the EU Green Deal to our living spaces
- video will be available at https://www.instagram.com/neweuropeanbauhaus/
### Information
How can we match sustainable innovation with style and social inclusion? On 15 September, the Commission presented a Communication on New European Bauhaus setting out the core principles, key actions and EU funding opportunities, that will drive the initiative forward, as it moves from co-design to delivery. Together with the growing New European Bauhaus community, we will work on the delivery of three interconnected transformations: - of places on the ground - of the environment that enables innovation - of our perspectives and mindsets Join the session and be part of the New European Bauhaus movement! 

## Financing renewables to deliver the European Green Deal: new options for cooperation
- video at https://youtu.be/um45qJ3SWPY 
### Information
The session will focus on two funding mechanisms recently introduced at EU level, namely the new sector of Cross-Border projects in the field of renewable energy, established under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Energy programme and the Renewable Energy Financing Mechanism (RENEWFM). These instruments are pivotal in enabling EU countries and regions to work more closely together to meet in a cost-effective way the collective 2030 EU renewable target as a stepping-stone towards a climate neutral energy system. Both mechanisms support the take-up and promotion of renewable energy projects and technologies. This session aims to increase awareness on these new funding mechanisms supporting cross-border cooperation among Member States and with third countries. It will facilitate discussions and exchanges with relevant stakeholders on their needs and expectations for the effective implementation of these mechanisms. 

## Gender justice in the energy poverty challenge in Europe
- video at https://youtu.be/bTmu7Myb0VE 
### Information
Women in all their diversity are disproportionately affected by energy poverty, yet are a strong actor against it. Currently, energy poverty policies are not paying sufficient attention, if any at all, to gender justice. This policy session aims to clarify how women in all their diversity are disproportionately affected by energy poverty; explain the gender dimension as an inequality factor, as well as other axes of inequality and vulnerability intersecting gender in manifestations of energy poverty; and propose recommendations on how to make policies against energy poverty gender just. The policy session is designed to open discussion on further solutions and policies for tackling energy poverty in a gender just manner. 

## Energy Storage: Financing and economic signals
- video at https://youtu.be/eS8Q2vIOreE 
### Information
The European Green Deal objectives will require a higher degree of electrification of our economies and a massive deployment of renewables, which will fundamentally change the current power system. More specifically, to keep a cost-efficient balance between electricity production and consumption, additional flexibility solutions will be needed.
Energy storage, together with other technologies, is one of the candidates to play a key role in achieving the decarbonisation objectives, by facilitating the electrification of the economy, the integration of renewables, and increasing the flexibility and security of the electricity system. Technologies and capacities should be market-driven on a level playing field, which requires adequate financing and economic signals.
In this session, we will discuss the current economic signals and needs for the uptake of energy storage technologies, the financing challenges they face building a business case and the bankability of projects, as well as the current financing tools and future needs.
